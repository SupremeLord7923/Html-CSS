   <p>A car dealership is a business that specializes in selling new or pre-owned vehicles to customers, often serving as the intermediary between car manufacturers and buyers. These dealerships typically offer a range of services, including vehicle financing, trade-ins, maintenance, and repairs. Modern dealerships often showcase a wide selection of makes and models in a showroom, complemented by test-drive opportunities to help customers make informed decisions. Beyond sales, many dealerships also emphasize building long-term relationships with customers by providing quality after-sales service, offering warranties, and ensuring customer satisfaction. Whether catering to individual buyers or fleet purchases, car dealerships aim to provide a seamless and comprehensive automotive purchasing experience.
